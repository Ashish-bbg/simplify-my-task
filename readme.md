# Simplify My Task

A simple **frontend web tool** to quickly analyze and count the frequency of **names** and **tasks** from text input.
It helps in identifying repetitive entries, calculating totals, and getting quick insights — no backend required.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

```
simplify-my-task/
├── index.html      # Main HTML structure
├── styles.css      # Styling and dark theme
└── script.js       # Core logic for text analysis
```

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Paste a list of names or tasks (one per line).
2. The script parses the input and removes unnecessary values (`N/A`, `Resource`, etc.).
3. It counts the frequency of each valid entry.
4. The results are shown in a formatted HTML table.
